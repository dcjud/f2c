# f2c Netlib mirror

This is a mirror of the *official* [Netlib
repository](https://netlib.org/f2c). No files are added (except this
README.md) or modified.

The purpose is to provide a version-stable repository of f2c. Currently,
when the netlib repository is updated, the URL and all file names remain
the same, This creates problems for people looking for a specific version
or release package.
